# bash-data-fetcher

### <b>Introduction</b><br>
<b>(A) Project Purpose<br></b>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to fetch and process data <br>
using pure Bash scripting. It provides a lightweight, dependency-minimal solution <br>
for accessing APIs, downloading datasets, and automating simple data retrieval tasks <br>
directly from the command line<br><br>
<b>(B) Brief Description</b><br>
"<i>bash-data-fetcher</i>" is a collection of reusable Bash scripts designed to interact <br>
with web APIs or public data sources using tools like <i>curl, wget, and jq</i>. The scripts <br>
include functionalities such as:<br>
1. Sending GET requests to RESTful APIs
2. Parsing JSON responses
3. Downloading and saving remote files
4. Scheduling fetch tasks via cron (optional)<br>
  
This project is ideal for those looking to automate data fetching without relying on heavier <br>
programming environments like Python or Node.js.<br><br>
<b>(C) Target Users</b><br>
This repository is created for:<br>
- System administrators who need to automate regular data pulls
- Data engineers working in low-resource environments or shell-first systems.
- Developers who want quick CLI tools for API testing and prototyping
- Linux/Bash learners seeking hands-on examples of practical shell scripting
