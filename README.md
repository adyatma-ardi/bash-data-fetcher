# bash-data-fetcher

### 📘 <b>Introduction</b><br>
(A) 🔍 Project Purpose<br>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to fetch and process data <br>
using pure Bash scripting. It provides a lightweight, dependency-minimal solution <br>
for accessing APIs, downloading datasets, and automating simple data retrieval tasks <br>
directly from the command line<br>
(B) 🛠️ Brief Description<br>
"<i>bash-data-fetcher</i>" is a collection of reusable Bash scripts designed to interact <br>
with web APIs or public data sources using tools like <i>curl, wget, and jq</i>. The scripts <br>
